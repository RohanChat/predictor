# MMA Fight Outcome Prediction

This project aims to predict the outcomes of MMA fights using machine learning techniques. Two different models have been developed and compared to evaluate their performance and suitability for the problem. The project consists of a detailed summary report, a Python notebook containing the implementation, a dataset containing the fight data, and a set of slides for a brief presentation.

## Files

### `Summary.pdf`

A 6-page PDF document providing an overview of the project, including:

- Introduction to the problem and the project's objectives
- A thorough walkthrough of the methods used in constructing the two models
- Presentation and analysis of the results and figures
- Evaluation and conclusions based on the results

### `Predictor.ipynb`

A Python notebook containing the following sections:

1. **Data preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps for cleaning and preparing the `masterdataframe.csv` dataset for use in the models.
2. **Construction and execution of Model 1**: Implementation and evaluation of Model 1, which uses logistic regression in combination with a feedforward neural network.
3. **Construction and execution of Model 2**: Implementation and evaluation of Model 2, which uses QR factorization and hyperparameter tuning to train an SVM classifier.

### `Predictor_Output.pdf`

A PDF document containing the output of the `Predictor.ipynb` notebook after it has been run, including all the visualizations and results generated by the two models.

### `Slides.pdf`

A set of slides providing a brief overview of the project and its outcomes, suitable for a short presentation. The slides cover the project's objectives, methods, results, and conclusions without going into too much detail.

### `masterdataframe.csv`

The dataset containing all the fight data used in the project. This file is essential for running the `Predictor.ipynb` notebook and training the models.

## How to use

1. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (e.g., pandas, numpy, sklearn, and any other libraries used in the `Predictor.ipynb` notebook).
2. Download the project files and unzip them into a folder.
3. Open the `Predictor.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or your preferred notebook viewer.
4. Run the notebook to train and evaluate the models using the `masterdataframe.csv` dataset.
5. Read the `Summary.pdf` document for an in-depth understanding of the project's objectives, methods, results, and conclusions.
6. View the `Slides.pdf` for a brief presentation on the project and its outcomes.
